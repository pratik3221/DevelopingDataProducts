## Engine Fuel Efficiency Plots

We try and understand the relationship between various factors and fuel used per mile using the `mtcars` data.

X axis vs. Y axis: weight of car(`wt`) versus mileage(`mpg`)
Colour of a plot point: Visualization of number of cylinders(`cyl`)
Size of a plot point: horsepower of the car(`hp`)

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```
